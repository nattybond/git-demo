I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them blue before me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Or also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying, I love you
